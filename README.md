How to Build a Network Honeypot (For Resume Use)
Goal: Create a basic honeypot that mimics a vulnerable service to log and analyze attack behavior. Showcase your skills in cybersecurity, logging, networking, and scripting.

 Step 1: Choose Your Honeypot Type
Decide what kind of honeypot you want to build:

Low-interaction honeypots (safer, easier):

Tools: Cowrie (SSH/Telnet), Honeyd, Dionaea, Glastopf (HTTP)

High-interaction honeypots (real services, more risk):

Tools: Build a vulnerable VM (e.g., Metasploitable or custom setup)

 Recommended for resume: Start with Cowrie (SSH honeypot) or Dionaea (malware collection)

 Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
Use a safe, isolated system or cloud VM (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, VirtualBox):

Install Ubuntu/Debian

Update system:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
Install Git, Python, and dependencies

Step 3: Install the Honeypot
Example: Install Cowrie

bash
Copy
Edit
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install git python3-venv python3-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential

# Clone Cowrie repo
git clone https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie.git
cd cowrie

# Setup virtual environment
python3 -m venv cowrie-env
source cowrie-env/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy config template
cp etc/cowrie.cfg.dist etc/cowrie.cfg
Configure as needed in etc/cowrie.cfg.

 Step 4: Run the Honeypot
bash
Copy
Edit
bin/cowrie start
Cowrie simulates an SSH/Telnet service

It logs credentials, commands, and sessions attackers try

Logs are stored in var/log/cowrie

 Step 5: Monitor and Analyze
Use Kibana/Elasticsearch or custom scripts to analyze logs

Look for:

Brute force attempts

Common malware payloads

Attacker IPs and behaviors

Step 6: Add Security Safeguards
Use firewalls or sandboxing (e.g., run in a container or isolated VM)

Do not expose it on your home network unless secured

Use a VPS with specific ports open
